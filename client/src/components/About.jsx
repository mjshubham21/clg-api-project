        This is a MERN stack application that showcases the use of RESTful APIs
        and integrates with the OpenWeather API. It serves as a demonstration of
        building a full-stack web application using MongoDB, Express, React, and
        Node.js.

        The application demonstrates how to create and manage a todo list using
        the backend API, and it also utilizes the OpenWeather API to fetch and
        display weather information for different cities.
